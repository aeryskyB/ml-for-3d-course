# Setup

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_dYbOeL9J7K7LbruNO-w2NYvloCzlBsp?usp=sharing)

Click the link above to open a Colab notebook with the code for this unit.

## Runtime

Multi-view diffusion, as well as other units in this course, require GPU.

In the notebook, click `Runtime` -> `Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.

Alternatively, you can run the notebook on your local machine if you have a GPU.

## Prerequisities

To run any code block in the notebook, click the `Play` button on the left side of the block.

We'll start by installing all necessary dependencies:

`pip install -r https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanebert/multi-view-diffusion/raw/main/requirements.txt`

If the notebook asks you to restart the session, do so, then rerun the code block. Youyou should see a green checkmark next to the code bl if everything is installed correctlyock.
