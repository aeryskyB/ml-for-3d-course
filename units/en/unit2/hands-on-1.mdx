# Hands-on (Part 1)

Time to host your own demo! In this portion, you will:

1. Create a model on Hugging Face.
2. Upload the necessary files to the model repository.

## Create a Model

Start by going to [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) and logging in or creating an account.

Then, click on `New` -> `Model` in the top left corner. Enter a model name, then click `Create model`.

Your model will be created at the url `https://huggingface.co/<your-username>/<your-model-name>`.

## Access Tokens

For security reasons, you'll need to create an access token to upload files to your model.

Go to [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and create a new access token with `write` access.

When git asks for your username and password, use your username and the access token as the password.

## Upload Files

Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't have it.

Open a terminal. Then, clone my existing [multi-view-diffusion](https://huggingface.co/dylanebert/multi-view-diffusion) model repository:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/dylanebert/multi-view-diffusion
cd multi-view-diffusion
```

Then, upload these files to your model repository:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://huggingface.co/<your-username>/<your-model-name>
git push
```

Replacing `<your-username>` and `<your-model-name>` with your username and model name.

Congratulations! If everything worked correctly, you should see your files at `https://huggingface.co/<your-username>/<your-model-name>`.
