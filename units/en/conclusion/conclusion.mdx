# Conclusion

Thank you for participating in the Machine Learning for 3D Course!

This has been a high-level overview of what's going on at the intersection of Machine Learning and 3D. For further exploration:

- Check out the [models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=image-to-3d&sort=trending) page for the latest image-to-3D models.
- Keep up with [3D Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanebert/3d-arena) for the latest state-of-the-art.
- Explore open-source projects like [InstantMesh](https://github.com/TencentARC/InstantMesh).
