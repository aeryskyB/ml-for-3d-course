# How to do it yourself

Before continuing with this course, there are some things that will be useful to be at least somewhat familiar with.

## Prerequisites

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - the version control system used throughout this course
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/) - the programming language used throughout this course
3. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - used very briefly in the last unit. Knowledge of concepts like vertices, faces, and UVs will be useful, but not critical
4. [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) - used to download and share models and datasets

If you aren't familiar with all of these, don't worry - you can still follow along.

## Wrapping up

By the end of this course, you'll have:

1. A better understanding of ML for 3D
2. Have built your own generative 3D demo

So let's get started!
