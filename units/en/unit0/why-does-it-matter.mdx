# Why does it matter?

## As a tool

3D is everywhere - from games, to movies, to retail.

As we've seen with 2D, machine learning can be an extremely useful tool.

This is likely already pretty obvious.

## For general intelligence

Something that's less obvious is the importance of 3D for general intelligence.

> In order to achieve general intelligence, AI needs to be grounded to the 3D world.

It's a popular claim that we need 3D for the next big leap in AI. However, there is no consensus on *how* 3D should be represented, or what it looks like to *understand* the 3D world.

This remains to be seen, and highlights the importance of research in this area.

## For you

Whether you are:

1. An ML-practitioner who wants to learn more about 3D
2. A 3D-practitioner who wants to learn more about ML
3. You have no idea why you're here

This is the course for you.
