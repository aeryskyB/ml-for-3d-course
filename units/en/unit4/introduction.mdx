## Meshes

Let's revisit the generative 3D pipeline.

Earlier in the course, we discussed the limitations of the mesh side of the pipeline, particularly with Marching Cubes, which produces dense and rough meshes unsuitable for production.

This is no longer the full story.

Recent advancements have emerged, allowing the conversion of dense meshes to low-poly meshes differentiably.

In this unit of the course, we'll cover:

- Marching Cubes
- Mesh Generation

Let's get started!
