# What is it?

Gaussian Splatting is a **differentiable rasterization technique**.

## Differentiable Rasterization

In simple terms:

- Differentiable can be thought of as a fancy way to say "AI-compatible"
- Rasterization means taking data and drawing it on the screen

Rasterization is already really common. It usually takes the form of [triangle rasterization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation), where 3D data is converted to 2D pixel data and drawn on the screen. That's how meshes are usually rendered.

However, triangle rasterization isn't very AI-compatible. This is because it includes discrete decisions like:

- Is this pixel inside the triangle?

Neural networks don't like discrete decisions. They want everything to be fuzzy and continous - or in other words, *differentiable*.

## Gaussian Splatting

Gaussian Splatting is a differentiable rasterization technique. But how does it actually work?

Splats are composed of millions of points, where each point is composed of four parameters:

- **Position**: where it's located (XYZ)
- **Covariance**: how it's stretched (3x3 matrix)
- **Color**: what color it is (RGB)
- **Alpha**: how transparent it is (Î±)

Then, to rasterize a splat, these points are projected into 2D. Then, for every pixel, contribute the contribution of every point. Or, in pseudocode:

```python
splat2d = splat.project_and_sort()
for point in splat2d:
    for pixel in image:
        pixel += compute_contribution(point, pixel)
```

The contribution of a point diminishes the further it is from the pixel. The points also need to be sorted, since they are blended back-to-front.

In theory, every point contributes to every pixel, which is very inefficient. However, that's okay, because it's *differentiable*.

In practice, this is optimized with a tile-based rasterization method, as detailed in the [original paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2308.04079).

## Inference

If you're not training a model, then it doesn't matter if it's differentiable. You can just treat each point as an instanced quad, as is in open-source web viewers like [gsplat.js](https://github.com/huggingface/gsplat.js).

This can be seen in action [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanebert/igf).

## Training

The [original paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2308.04079) intializes the points using [Structure-from-Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion), a traditional algorithm for 3D reconstruction.

These points are then rasterized using the tile-based method, and the loss is computed by comparing the rasterized image to the ground truth. Gradient descent is applies to adjust the point parameters (position, covariance, color, alpha).

The original paper also uses automated densification and pruning to automatically add and remove points as needed. More details can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/gaussian-splatting).

## Generative 3D

The original approach is suitable for learning individual scenes from photos. However, the concept is differentiable rasterization generalizes to more complex models like neural networks.

This is the case with generative 3D models like [LGM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanebert/LGM-mini), which we'll be using in the next section to build our own generative 3D demo.
